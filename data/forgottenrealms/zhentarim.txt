The Zhentarim, previously known as the Black Network, was a mercenary company, and greater mercantile organization in Faer没n,[9] who, over their 200 years of existence, has had a storied history as a cadre of self-serving thieves, spies, assassins and malevolent wizards,[10] who for a time, were indentured by their leaders to serve dark gods Bane[11] and Cyric.[12] Over the decades, the organization experienced several leaps and bounds in terms of successes,[13] but also major misfortune, particularly for their historical strongholds around the Moonsea.[14] As of 1489 DR the Zhentarim was headquartered in the Western Heartlands, at Darkhold Castle, nestled in the valley of the same name.[9]

As an extension of the will of the dark wizard Manshoon, the Zhentarim was initially formed as a mercenary company to support his rule over the Moonsea with the aim of spreading that control over all of Faer没n.[15] After he recruited the faithful of Bane, unscrupulous merchants and lesser mages to his cause,[16] they collectively sought to dominate all aspects of the Realms, either by manipulation, outright control or, if they couldn't exert control over something, extinction.[17]

After the mass purge of the Cyricists, known as the Banedeath, and the subsequent partial destruction of Zhentil Keep following the Cyrinishad debacle, the power of the Zhentarim passed to the Bane-worshiping Fzoul Chembryl. He made secret deals with leaders in the Moonsea to erect temples to Iyachtu Xvim, the divine son of Bane, within the capitals of their city-states. His aim to extend the will of the Lord of Tyrants across Toril was a dynamic factor behind many of the changes within the organization.[15] He sought to use the Black Network to set the stage for the return of the Lord of Tyrants.[citation needed]

By the late 15th century the goals of the Zhentarim came in line with their original ideals, despite their more benign public perception. By offering the best guards and mercenaries, with the final aim of an iron-fisted monopoly on protection services in the Realms, they sought to make the merchants of Faer没n, and thus the continental economy, completely reliant upon them as an organization. While many of their practices and services they offered were completely legal, they were not above spending a tremendous amount of gold to destroy their competitors and secure future profits to increase their wealth, influence and power.[18]

In order to achieve their financial goals the Zhentarim agents often dealt in illicit goods and contraband, using their extensive mercantile contacts to move products throughout the Moonsea, neighboring lands and over Faer没n's more hazardous terrains. The types of commodities they dealt in were slaves, poison, drugs and even smokepowder weapons.[19]

As a means of eliminating their competition, the Zhentarim used the Zhentilar army of Zhentil Keep or recruited bands of monstrous humanoids to take down rival caravans, often completing the route under their own banner to earn good faith and new business with merchant groups. They were not above resorting to sabotage, blackmail, arson to outright murder to undermine their mercantile or political opponents. They were even known to purposefully upset the balance of natural beasts, stir up aggressive monster populations within the wild, and even have their mages summon foul monstrosities to threaten isolated towns and villages, in effect forcing the residents to rely upon the protection of the Zhentilar.[19]

From the early years of the organization until 1369 DR, a few years prior the resurrection of Bane, the Zhentarim's was ruled by the triumvirate of Manshoon, the ultimate authority and Lord of Zhentil Keep, Sememmon, his arcane student who presided over Darkhold, and Fzoul Chembryl, the High Priest of Bane.[20] The Zhentarim was rife with mistrust, even amongst its upper echelons. While Manshoon had a bond of trust with his pupil Sememmon, his relationship with Fzoul was one of mutual disdain shrouded by public respect. While the three shared the same goal of increasing their collective wealth and power, it was at best an uneasy alliance that ultimately fell apart.[13]

Manshoon: In addition to his role as the ultimate authority of the Zhentarim, Manshoon held the title of High Lord of Zhentil keep, speaker of the city-state's Council of Lords and had the full backing of the Zhentilar army.[21] He kept close control over the Moonsea Zhentarim, and controlled the other city states such as Hillsfar, the Citadel of the Raven and even Mulmaster,[22] either through manipulation of their leadership or outright force.[citation needed] Prior to the partial destruction of Zhentil Keep, Manshoon moved his operations over to the Citadel,[23] avoiding the chaos brought on by the Cyricists following the Banedeath.[citation needed]

Sememmon: The obedient and skillful lieutenant of Manshoon long served as the Lord of Darkhold and unfailingly loyal servant of the Zhentarim.[24] Due to its distance from Manshoon and the Moonsea Zhentarim, the mage-lord only recruited the most loyal and capable agents, about 1000 strong, to the dark keep hidden within the Far Hills.[25] Sememmon's second-in-command was the powerful mage Ashemmi, a former Harper, his consort and true love.[24][26][27]

Fzoul Chembryl: Before he became the exarch of Bane following the Spellplague,[28] the faithful servant Fzoul served as the Dark God's chosen,[citation needed] and the High Priest of his clergy at the Black Altar in Zhentil Keep.[20]
