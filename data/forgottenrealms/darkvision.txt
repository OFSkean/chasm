Darkvision, also known as infravision,[1][note 1] was a type of vision that many creatures had, in addition to "normal sight", that allowed them to see in darkness.[2][3][4][5]

“
So you sneak around in the dark? You know most everything but humans can see in the dark right? We all see you. Tiptoeing doesn't turn you invisible.
”
— The beholder Xanathar to a gloom stalker ranger.[6]

Description
Darkvision allowed a creature to discern forms, as in normal daylight vision, but only in shades of gray. Monsters with this ability could only see in the dark up to a certain distance,[2][4][5] typically around 20 yards (18 meters).[7] Permanently subterranean creatures often possessed superior darkvision that allowed them to see in the dark at distances twice that far.[8][9] Darkvision did not function in darkness that was magical in origin.[10][11]

Despite the name "infravision", this form of vision did not allow creatures to see light that fell within the infrared spectrum;[7] it did not involve heat-sensing, and so sources of light or heat did not affect it.[1]

Creatures
Creatures known to have darkvision included drow,[8] duergar,[9] dwarves,[3] svirfneblin, and many others.[12]
