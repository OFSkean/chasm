The Last Stag is a large stag beetle and the last of his kind in Hallownest.[1] During the kingdom's heyday, stags were used to transport bugs and goods across the land through the Stagways.[1] When Hallownest fell, travels died down and most of the Stag Stations were closed.[3][4]


The Last Stag travelling the Stagways

Even though his own kind disappeared and old age starts impairing him, the Last Stag remains faithful to his duties.[5][6] He transports any bug calling him with the bell of a Station, wherever they are. However, his memory has been lacking and he forgot where the Stations are located on the Stagways, even the Stag Nest.[7] Yet, the Last Stag keeps a good memory of the places he once visited and still remembers much of Hallownest's golden age.[8]

His dedication to the Stagways makes him dislike the Tramways the Pale King was building before the latter's disappearance.[9] He also makes no difference between his riders, despite his own feelings about them.[10]
