SpongeBob SquarePants (born July 14, 1986[8]) is the main protagonist of the animated series of the same name. He was designed by show creator and former marine biologist, the late Stephen Hillenburg. Hillenburg based SpongeBob on Bob the Sponge, a character he had created for his educational book The Intertidal Zone in the late 1980s.

SpongeBob is a childish, joyful, and clumsy sea sponge who lives in a pineapple with his pet snail Gary in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. 
SpongeBob's house.

He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a job which he is exceptionally skilled at and enjoys thoroughly. He attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School, and his greatest dream in life is to receive his boating license. Unfortunately, he tenses up whenever he has to drive a boatmobile, and he drives recklessly. SpongeBob is very good-natured and loves to hang out with his best friend, Patrick. His teacher is Mrs. Puff and his boss is Mr. Krabs.
In The SpongeBob Musical, SpongeBob's exact species of sea sponge is identified: Aplysina fistularis, a yellow sea sponge that is commonly found in open waters.[9]

SpongeBob appears in some form in every episode of the series, beginning with the series' debut episode, "Help Wanted." He is voiced by Tom Kenny, who is married to Karen Plankton's voice actress, Jill Talley.

Production details

SpongeBob is a poriferan, better known as a sea sponge. In this promo art, he is shown with his scientific classification.

While Stephen Hillenburg worked as a teacher of marine science at the Ocean Institute in California, he created an educational book called The Intertidal Zone. The book was intended for children and taught about the behaviors of different sea creatures. Bob the Sponge, a natural sea sponge with sunglasses, was the "host" of the book.

Hillenburg revisited the concept of The Intertidal Zone in 1996 when he started sketching concepts for a cartoon series about undersea life. He wanted the title character to be an under-represented creature, with the rest of the main characters being iconic and easily recognizable sea animals: a crab, a whale, and a starfish. "What's the weirdest animal? The sponge came to mind," he recalled in 2012.[10] As he drew a sea sponge character, he originally wanted to use the shape of a natural sponge, but later decided that a "squeaky-clean square" would better portray a nerdy personality.

An early colored sketch portrayed SpongeBob as wearing a red hat with a green base and a white business shirt with a tie. SpongeBob's look gradually progressed to brown pants that were used in the final design. SpongeBob was designed to be a kid-like character who was goofy and optimistic in a style similar to that made famous by Jerry Lewis.[11]

The character was initially going to be named "SpongeBoy," but the name was already in use by other products including a pencil. This was discovered after voice acting for the original seven-minute pilot was recorded in 1997.[12] Upon finding this out, Hillenburg decided that the character's name still had to contain "Sponge" so that viewers would not mistake the character for a "Cheese Man," and decided to use the name "SpongeBob." He chose "SquarePants" as a family name since it referred to the character's square shape and it had a "nice ring to it."[13]

When Hillenburg pitched SpongeBob to Nickelodeon in 1997, the network gave him an order: they would only produce the show if SpongeBob was a kid who went to school, like "Arnold from Hey Arnold! under the sea."[14] Hillenburg was prepared to "walkout" on Nickelodeon, as writing SpongeBob as a school-aged child went against his creative vision.[15] However, he came up with Mrs. Puff and her Boating School as a compromise, allowing SpongeBob to attend school as an adult. Hillenburg was very fond of the "way things worked out," as Nickelodeon's order brought in a whole new main character, "Mrs. Puff, who I love."[15]

SpongeBob is voiced by veteran voice actor Tom Kenny. Kenny had previously worked with Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life, and when Hillenburg created SpongeBob SquarePants, he approached Kenny to voice the character. Hillenburg used Kenny's and other actors' personalities to help create the personality of SpongeBob.[12]

Kenny first used the voice for SpongeBob for a minor female alligator character named Al on Rocko's Modern Life, who appeared in the episode "Dear John." This is also the first time Kenny and Stephen Hillenburg worked together. Hillenburg wanted Kenny to use that voice for SpongeBob, so he showed him a clip of Al in Rocko's Modern Life to remind Kenny of the voice.[12] Kenny says that SpongeBob's high-pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.[16]

In SpongeBob SquarePants broadcast in non-English languages, the voice actors dubbing SpongeBob's voice use Tom Kenny's rendition of the character as a starting point but also add unique elements. For example, the French version has SpongeBob with a slight Daffy Duck-style lisp.[12]

Biography

SpongeBob's character file.

According to his driver's license in the episode "Sleepy Time," SpongeBob SquarePants was born on July 14, 1986. SpongeBob's license is seen again with this birthdate in "No Free Rides," but all further appearances of it remove the birthdate. He celebrates four respective unspecified birthdays in the episodes "I Had an Accident," "SpongeBob Meets the Strangler," "Waiting," and "SpongeBob's Big Birthday Blowout." In the latter, he nearly reveals his age but is narrowly cut off by the episode's ending, making it a mystery. Stephen Hillenburg once joked that SpongeBob is 50 in "sponge years." Taking into account the average lifespan of a yellow tube sponge being just over 100 years, this would make him middle-aged. Jokes aside, Hillenburg explained that SpongeBob actually has no specific age, but that "he is old enough to be on his own and still be going to driving school," firmly confirming him to be an adult.

He lives with his pet sea snail Gary in a large pineapple-shaped house on 124 Conch Street, Bikini Bottom. His next-door neighbor, Squidward Tentacles, who lives in an Easter Island head, is constantly annoyed by his antics. SpongeBob is oblivious to this and believes Squidward to be his friend. Beside Squidward's house is the home of SpongeBob's best friend, Patrick Star, who lives under a rock.

SpongeBob works at the Krusty Krab, Bikini Bottom's most popular restaurant, where he is a fry cook and prepares all food served at the restaurant, most notably Krabby Patties. In "Help Wanted," SpongeBob applied for this job. He says that it has been his lifelong dream to join the Krusty Krew and that only now is he "ready." When he applies for the job, Squidward and Mr. Krabs, wanting no part of him, send him on a fool's errand for a "hydro-dynamic spatula with port and starboard attachments and turbo drive." While he is out searching for one at Barg'N-Mart, several hundred hungry anchovies arrive and overwhelm Squidward and Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob soon returns, having found a hydrodynamic spatula, and saves their lives by feeding the anchovies, showing off his amazing cooking skills in the process.

SpongeBob's house is an orange pineapple with fully furnished windows and doors and has a gas pipe. When he first moved to Bikini Bottom, he viewed many different houses, but none seemed to his liking. Just as he was about to give up, a pineapple from a boat above the water falls into the sea and lands onto the space that was Squidward's garden where Squidward was still gardening. SpongeBob loves the house and buys it, leaving Squidward in misery by losing his garden and having SpongeBob living next to him. However, in The Patrick Star Show episode "Who's a Big Boy?," SpongeBob bumps into his future house as a teenager while it's still under construction and already under the water, along with Squidward's house.

While not working, SpongeBob spends much of his time playing with his best friend, Patrick Star. The two have known each other since their early childhood, and are members of the "Best Friends Forever Club."[17] Their usual activities include jellyfishing, bubble blowing, and various others. The two's antics are of constant annoyance to their next-door neighbor, Squidward, and he has been repeatedly put into harm's way as a result of their actions. This is shown when SpongeBob innocently sends DoodleBob to prank Squidward, only for the drawing to beat up Squidward in "Frankendoodle." Because of their annoyance, Squidward has tried to move away numerous times, but always ends up returning.[18]

Despite Squidward claiming to hate SpongeBob and Patrick, they are completely oblivious to this and believe they are his best friends. Squidward is usually shown to dislike SpongeBob in particular, but the two share a close relationship. Squidward has hinted that he likes SpongeBob a lot more than he lets on. In "Graveyard Shift," he admits this when he tells SpongeBob, "No matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!" Also, in "SB-129," he misses SpongeBob after becoming trapped in a blank dimension. In "Dying for Pie," he shows sadness over SpongeBob being set to explode at sunset from eating the exploding pie, although this doesn't happen since SpongeBob kept the pie in his pocket the whole time and didn't eat it.

One of SpongeBob's good friends is a squirrel from Texas named Sandy Cheeks, who wears a special suit and helmet to survive underwater. When SpongeBob first met Sandy, she invited SpongeBob to her airtight home, and SpongeBob, not knowing what air is, accepted. After giving in to his need to breathe water, SpongeBob and Patrick got bowls of water to wear over their heads from Sandy, which they typically wear whenever they visit the treedome. Sandy enjoys SpongeBob's company and they enjoy doing extreme sports together, most notably karate.

SpongeBob's skills in karate are shown to vary quite considerably; for example, in "Karate Choppers," he equals and even outmatches Sandy in skill. However, at most other times he is so weak to the point where Sandy can send him flying a considerable distance with a single punch, which happens in "No Weenies Allowed." In "Karate Island," Sandy openly states that her karate skills are better than SpongeBob's by "a country mile."

Another of SpongeBob's friends is Mr. Krabs' whale daughter, Pearl Krabs. According to "Bossy Boots," Pearl thinks SpongeBob is "full of style," "oozes fashion," and most importantly, "is a great pal." Pearl goes to prom with SpongeBob in "The Chaperone" to make her feel better over being dumped by her boyfriend. In "Tunnel of Glove," it is revealed that Pearl's classmates think SpongeBob is her boyfriend, and SpongeBob inadvertently supports this by saying "Well, I am a boy, and I am her friend." The two then go on the Tunnel of Glove ride together. In "A Cabin in the Kelp," Pearl uses SpongeBob as a way to prank the Gal Pals, as her suspicion detects that the titular group will prank her first and is utterly saddened by the fact SpongeBob is missing. She is later delighted about how SpongeBob is safe but is just lost within a forest.

SpongeBob attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School, where he is taught by his idolized teacher Mrs. Puff. He studies extremely hard for school and knows every answer to the oral exam, but he becomes extremely nervous when actually behind the wheel of a boat, causing him to fail the final exam every time. According to the episode "Mrs. Puff, You're Fired," SpongeBob has failed the exam 1,258,056 times, and is the only creature in the history of the school to fail the test.

Despite his inability to drive a boatmobile properly, SpongeBob is able to drive/ride various other things capably, including a rock, a rocket ship, a sandwich car, and a submarine. SpongeBob claims that he does know how to drive, but simply panics behind the wheel and cannot concentrate. In "Mrs. Puff, You're Fired," SpongeBob receives extremely good training from Mrs. Puff's very tough military-like replacement and learns how to drive capably, but can only do so while blindfolded due to the teacher's strict drills and very specific teaching methods.

Description

SpongeBob's official color palette (top) includes 16 colors, plus black and white.

SpongeBob is a sea sponge with a rectangular shape. He is light yellow (whose exact shade of yellow is designated by Pantone to be SpongeBob Yellow[19]) with a light olive-green outline. In earlier episodes, he is wider near the top and gets skinnier going further down, akin to that of a trapezoid. However, in the more recent episodes, he is more of a regular square shape.

SpongeBob has light olive-green pores, dimples with three freckles on each cheek, a large mouth with two prominent front buck teeth, a long, slightly curved nose, and large light blue eyes. His eye color seems to be, uniquely, a shade of pacific blue complimenting the blue ocean background. He has three exceptionally wide, exposed, and effeminate eyelashes on each eye (which disappear whenever his eyes are closed or his brows are lowered), which have sometimes been shown to be numerous eyelashes akin to a human, which is best prominent in "Tutor Sauce" when he is seen breathing heavily during a close-up.

Although rarely seen in the series, he has light yellow hair that goes hand-in-hand with his skin color, as seen on his driver's license, the spin-off series The Patrick Star Show, and in the episode "The Sponge Who Could Fly." However, in the episode "Krusty Krab Training Video," he instead has a simple strand of black hair.

He typically wears a white shirt with a scarlet-red tie, black leather shoes with white shoelaces, white socks with blue and red stripes, and brown rectangular pants with a black belt. While working at the Krusty Krab, he wears a tall, white hat with a small blue anchor illustration as a uniform. SpongeBob usually sleeps in his briefs, and at other times-beginning with season 5-his pajamas. However, he occasionally sleeps with his entire outfit on, which was more common in season 1, most notably the episode "Sleepy Time."

In various spin-off media, he is slightly redesigned. In Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years, his outfit stays mostly the same as in the original show, but now he wears a red cap and a handkerchief, as well as brown boots. In The Patrick Star Show, SpongeBob has a bit of yellow hair on his head, wears a bow tie, and black-and-white saddle shoes.

Though SpongeBob has always been voiced by Tom Kenny, his voice has changed throughout the series; his voice is lower than normal in season 1. After the first movie, his voice noticeably changes, increasing in pitch, along with other changes. After season 9, his voice slightly decreases in pitch.

Even though he is a sea sponge, he has legs and is able to move, just like the other sponges in the show. This is pointed out in "I Had an Accident," when he says that he will stay in his house forever, and he shouldn't have even been walking in the first place because he's a sponge.

Health
While SpongeBob is generally lucky in life and healthy, he has on several occasions faced health problems in the series, which are usually caused by his tendency to fall for antagonists' manipulation or simply by accident. On a side note, he is an invertebrate and thus lacks bones, making him immune to physical harm; however, this varies greatly by episode, as sometimes SpongeBob is depicted as having bones and thus prone to suffering injuries, while in other episodes, most notably "The Bully," he has none and is, therefore, accepting of his said injuries. Like most other characters from the show, he has faced many fatal injuries and near-death experiences. However, due to cartoon physics and negative continuity, he sometimes recovers immediately afterward without medical support. Such instances are played for comedy and do not affect the plot, therefore they will be overlooked when taking into account SpongeBob's health. However, SpongeBob has on more than one occasion faced ongoing medical conditions and injuries that have even been the core of the plot.

The first prominent instance of SpongeBob's health deteriorating is in "Tea at the Treedome," where he for the first time enters an air pollution, Sandy's treedome, after meeting a new friend. Due to the insufficient amount of water in her house, he starts to shrivel up before eventually passing out--along with Patrick--on the ground from hypothermia. Both he and Patrick are subsequently revived by Sandy's new creation, water helmets.

Towards the end of "Jellyfishing," he and Patrick get stung by the Queen Jellyfish and are left covered in bandages.

In "Plankton!," Plankton takes control of SpongeBob by entering into his head at night and using a control on his brain to control SpongeBob's body movements as a means of obtaining the Krabby Patty secret formula for Plankton to hear out loud.

In "Pickles," after Bubble Bass tells SpongeBob he forgot to put pickles on his Krabby Patty, SpongeBob falls into a state of despair as he loses his confidence. He starts doing everything backwards, like talking improperly, walking backwards, and hammering a piece of toast into his kitchen counter. He is cured from the state once he abruptly makes a Krabby Patty while listing all the ingredients as he puts them together in that order, which was an angry attempt to prove Mr. Krabs that he can't make one contrary to Krabs' encouragement.

In "I Was a Teenage Gary," Squidward accidentally injects SpongeBob with the snail plasma when he meant to inject it into Gary. This causes SpongeBob to transform into a snail and say nothing but "Meow" as he chases Squidward around. Instead of being cured, Squidward himself gets injected with the needle too and sings with Snail-SpongeBob and Gary on the fence towards the end.

In "Fools in April," he gets his leg tied to a rope while cleaning up a mustard stain on the floor of the Krusty Krab as part of Squidward's prank. SpongeBob gets sent flying into several poles, windows, and bags of flour, and ends up in a trash can covered in garbage. This causes him to cry and run home, falling into a state of depression afterwards.

SpongeBob's sickness is a plot point of "Suds," where he becomes infected by the eponymous disease which gives him a cold and causes him to sneeze pink bubbles through his pores. He caught it from accidentally leaving his freezer open overnight and falling asleep in the kitchen. "Doctor Patrick" tries to cure SpongeBob by using many ridiculous methods which only worsen his condition and inflate him into a giant ball, causing him to roll down a hill and crash into the Krusty Krab, which makes him sneeze a massive number of bubbles and deflate, albeit still with a cold. He is eventually cured by Incidental 116 utilizing a special treatment for sponges.

In "Something Smells," he gets bad breath from eating a sundae with ketchup, onions, and his peanut plant. Everyone in town turns away from him vehemently, which Patrick thinks is because he's ugly, but they find out in the end that it was the sundae when Patrick develops rancid breath from eating it too.

In "Prehibernation Week," Sandy takes SpongeBob on numerous increasingly dangerous adventures where they participate in extreme sports games, drastically injuring SpongeBob and taking a toll on his health.

At the end of "Survival of the Idiots," Sandy, having had her fur ripped off by the duo, uses SpongeBob and Patrick's bodies as a replacement; since the two are in her treedome and have no provision of water, they nearly die from hypothermia again.

In "Squirrel Jokes," SpongeBob suffers from hypothermia yet again upon entrance of Sandy's treedome and is given too much water by her through a hose, inflating him to the point of taking up the dome's capacity.

SpongeBob's health is put at risk in "The Bully" when a new classmate, Flats the Flounder, joins and threatens to kick SpongeBob's butt. Concerned for his safety, SpongeBob pulls off many attempts to hide from the bully and expose him, but no one in town can help him. As a result, SpongeBob comes to terms with Flats harming him and lets him "kick [his] butt." However, SpongeBob's body simply absorbs Flats' punches, leading to no harm whatsoever; in fact, SpongeBob lets Flats harm him routinely everyday until Flats passes out unconscious in class one day.

In "No Weenies Allowed," he breaks his fingers after a failed attempt to crack his knuckles and soaks them in an ice cream sundae to heal them. Towards the end of the episode, after his goal of being tough enough to enter The Salty Spitoon is finally achieved, he slips on an ice cube and falls to the ground, having to be sent into an ambulance afterward. Due to him describing his condition as "boo-boos," the Purple Doctorfish suggests he seek care at Weenie Hut General.
