Merino Sheep are domesticated animals. They can be encountered in ranches. Valentine is famous for being a sheep-auctioning town, and Merino Sheep can be seen in large numbers in the town's sheep-pens. Occasionally, a shepherd can be encountered outside Horseshoe Overlook, herding Merino Sheep with their dog. Players should note that killing Merino Sheep will result in a loss of honor, as they are passive domesticated animals. Killing Merino Sheep in ranches and towns will turn nearby ranchers and civilians hostile, and witnesses can report the killing as Animal Cruelty to local lawmen. Skinning Merino Sheep will yield Sheep Hides and Gristly Mutton.

A unique black Merino Sheep with a pink ribbon can be encountered at Heartland Overflow.[1] The sheep can be seen travelling alone. Killing the sheep will result in a loss of honor. The player cannot skin the sheep, but they can loot a golden wedding ring from it. The same sheep can be found dead in a pen in Guthrie Farm, next to a half-naked human corpse.
