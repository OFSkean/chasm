Godskin Noble is an reoccurring enemy and boss in Elden Ring . Stout humanoids who wear robes sewn together from patches of soft skin, featuring seven-faced aprons.[1] They are the most ancient of the apostles who once served the Gloam-Eyed Queen[2], and they have incorporated inhuman physiology, not unlike the primordial crucible.[1] They wield elegant thrusting swords with skill unmatched by lowborns[3], and wield black flame much like the Godskin Apostles.
