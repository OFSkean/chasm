A red haired woman afflicted by Scarlet Rot. Millicent and her sisters were found in the Swamp of Aeonia in Caelid by Sage Gowry, who raised them as his daughters.[1] Her four sisters travelled to Miquella's Haligtree under Gowry's guidance[2], however Millicent alone remained behind.

On Gowry's behest[3], the Tarnished obtains an Unalloyed Gold Needle and brings it to the Church of the Plague, where Millicent is slowly succumbing to the Rot. The Tarnished uses the needle to stall the Rot, allowing Millicent to regain lucidity.[4] However, her memories appear to have been affected by her sickness, as when she struggles to remember Gowry upon returning to his shack to find it abandoned.[5]

Millicent sets off on a journey across the Lands Between, retracing the route taken by Malenia, Blade of Miquella after the battle of Aeonia.[6] She once again meets the Tarnished on the Altus Plateau, where they present her with a Valkyrie's Prosthesis to replace her missing sword arm.[7]

Millicent's journey takes her to the Mountaintops of the Giants, in search of a fort containing a medallion which will allow her to access the Haligtree.[8] After the Tarnished claims the medallion and travels to the Consecrated Snowfield, Millicent makes her way to the Haligtree, and to Elphael, the city at its base. Here, she reveals to the Tarnished that she is of Malenia's blood, although she is unsure whether she is a sister, daughter, or offshoot of the Demigod.[9] Unbeknownst to Millicent, however, the Tarnished has been advised by Gowry to assist his remaining four daughters in killing Millicent, so that she can be reborn as a scarlet valkyrie when Malenia ascends to godhood.[10]

The Tarnished may then make a choice: kill Millicent alongside her four sisters, or fight alongside her against the attackers. Should the Tarnished kill Millicent, she will become a scarlet aeonia flower, waiting for Malenia's ascension. If the player fights alongside her, she will remove the needle from her body, allowing her to succumb to the Rot.
