Godskin Apostle is a reoccurring boss in Elden Ring. Lanky humanoids clad in robes sewn together from patches of smooth skin.[1] The Godskin Apostles were led by the Gloam-Eyed Queen[2], who cradled them as newborns in a swaddling cloth made from skin much like their robes[3]. They served Destined Death[1], and wielded god-slaying black flame. However, when Maliketh, the Black Blade, sealed away the Rune of Death, the flame's true power was lost.[4]
