Miquella, like his twin sister Malenia, was born afflicted. While Malenia was born with rot in her body, Miquella was cursed with the body of a perpetually young child.[1] The twins were very close, and Malenia would become her brother's sworn blade and protector,[2] while Miquella worked tirelessly to try and undo the curses they had both been born into. He made a promise to Malenia, who regarded him as the most fearsome Empyrean.[3] Miquella is said to be loved by many people, indeed he has the ability to compel affection from others.[4]

As an Empyrean, Miquella was chosen by his own Two Fingers as a possible candidate to succeed Queen Marika as a new god of the coming age.[5] He was an adherent of the Golden Order fundamentalism, developing new incantations as gifts to his father Radagon.[6][7] However, Miquella would abandoned fundamentalism when he found out it was unable to treat Malenia's rot. It was then that he began creating Unalloyed gold.[8] He used it to craft needles that could ward away the meddling of outer gods and thus forestall Malenia's incurable rot,[9] and would later even subdue the power of the Frenzied Flame.[10] He would also unsuccessfully try to find a solution for his half-brother Godwyn and his state of incomplete death.[11][12]

At some point, Miquella started watering a sapling with his own blood in the hope that it would become a new Erdtree.[13] The sapling was grown on top of the fortress of Elphael and became known as the Haligtree. Soldiers and Knights sworn to protect the Haligtree would use Unalloyed gold as a symbol of their loyalty and devotion to Miquella, wearing crowns made of the metal and creating shields imbedded with it.[14][15][16][17] Miquella was in turn said to bless the low and meek.[14] The Haligtree would became a hidden haven,[18] and a best chance for salvation for many of the persecuted and the unwanted in the Lands Between, such as the Albinaurics.[19]

Miquella embedded himself into the Haligtree, possibly in order to grow to adulthood and thus come closer to achieving true godhood. Before he could finish this process, someone cut the tree open and abducted Miquella's sleeping form.[20] In truth it was his half-brother Mohg, Lord of Blood, who had gained power from an outer god known only as the Formless Mother.[21] Mohg took the slumbering Empyrean's infant form deep underground, where he worked to raise Miquella to full godhood, wishing to become his consort, create a new dynasty, and take the role of monarch.[22] He would have his followers render offerings of blood and drench Miquella's cocoon in order to facilitate his awakening.[23] Despite all of Mohg's efforts, no matter how much of his bloody bedchamber he tried to share, Miquella would remain completely unresponsive.[22]

With Miquella's absence, his Haligtree grew horribly misshapen and became a husk.[17][24] The Haligtree's soldiers desperately awaited Miquella's return to the rotten tree.[25] After Malenia's battle with General Radahn in Caelid, one of her knights carried her slumbering body back to the Haligtree.[26] At the root of the tree, Malenia waited for her twin brother to return.[27]

Once Mohg is defeated, Sir Gideon Ofnir informs the Tarnished that it might be safer to destroy the cocoon that Miquella remains asleep in.[28]
