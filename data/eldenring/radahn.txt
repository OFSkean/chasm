Radahn was the son of Queen Rennala and Radagon, and became a demigod stepchild after his father's marriage to Queen Marika.[2] He is regarded as the mightiest hero of the demigods,[3] and was one of the strongest participants of the Shattering.
Pre-Shattering

Radahn was born the son of Radagon, a champion of the Erdtree, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and Academy of Raya Lucaria. He had two siblings, Rykard and Ranni. Radahn inherited his father's flaming red hair, and was fond of its heroic implications.[4] From a young age, he was enamored with the Elden Lord Godfrey. Attempting to emulate his idol, Radahn adorned his armor with lions, the symbol of Godfrey.[5]

At some point, the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, was robbed of grace and hounded from the Lands Between. Radahn's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become Queen Marika's new consort and the second Elden Lord.[6] Radahn and his siblings were thus raised to demigod status by their new step-mother, Marika.[7]

Radahn grew to a massive size, eventually outgrowing his scrawny but beloved steed, Leonard.[8][9] Not wanting to abandon his horse, Radahn studied gravitational magic in Sellia under a master who was an Alabaster Lord.[10]

Mastering gravitational magic allowed Radahn to manipulate the forces of gravity, and to challenge the very stars themselves.[11] Radahn conquered the stars, saving Sellia in the process, using his vast gravitational powers to 'shatter' the stars and arrest their cycles, earning him the moniker of "Starscourge." During this time, he engraved the gravity crest upon his blades.[3]

Radahn's soldiers were known as the Redmanes for the red-maned lion raising a sword in the image of Radahn on their surcoats.[12] The longest serving of the Redmane Knights was Ogha, who studied gravitational techniques alongside Radahn in Sellia.[13] It was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness.[14] At an unknown period in time, Jerren, a guest of the Carian royals, became a guest commander for Radahn's armies, and they swore a mutual oath of honorable death.[15][16]
The Shattering

At some point following the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the Shattering, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.[1]

From his stronghold of Redmane Castle in the Caelid Wilds, Radahn led his armies against the forces of the other demigods. By the end of the Shattering, only Radahn and his half-sister Malenia, Blade of Miquella were the mightiest left standing. The two fought to a stalemate in the Battle of Aeonia, which ended when Malenia unleashed her Scarlet Rot.[17]

The Scarlet Rot ravaged Caelid, and consumed Radahn from the inside, eating away at his psyche. Following the Battle of Aeonia, Radahn roams the Wailing Dunes a mindless beast who devours the flesh of friend and foe alike, howling at the sky.[18] Without their commander, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve to not return home, and to serve as a bulwark against the spread of the rot in Caelid using fire.[19][20]

In spite of his madness, Radahn continues to ride Leonard, as well as hold the motions of the stars. The Radahn Festival has been organized by his men in Castle Redmane to celebrate his last battle and his death. It is a gathering of mighty warriors who might finally put the General out of his misery, and claim his Great Rune for themselves. The festival serves as Jerren's way of fulfilling his oath of honorable death to Radahn.

Upon the participation of The Tarnished (Protagonist), the festival is a success, and Radahn is freed from his tortured existence. This causes the stars to resume their cycles, some of which come crashing down upon the Lands Between. One such falling star lands in Limgrave, opening the path to Nokron, Eternal City, and allowing Ranni the Witch's fate to progress.
