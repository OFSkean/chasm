The Radiance is the secret final boss of Hollow Knight. Godmaster content Absolute Radiance is her perfect form.


Lore
The Radiance is a higher being[3] of light similar to Essence, and as such, opposed to the Void, her ancient enemy.[4][5] The Moth Tribe is born from her light and in return revered her.[4]

In-game events
From her prison, the Radiance, heart of the Infection, plagues the dreams of bugs. She infects Myla[20], causing her to attack the Knight, and uses Lightseeds and Infected flies to reanimate the Broken Vessel and the Watcher Knights. After killing at least one Dreamer, or obtaining the Monarch Wings, the Infection worsens in the Forgotten Crossroads, turning it into the Infected Crossroads, and making its bugs more violent and dangerous.

Her fate is linked to the end of the Knight's journey. By defeating the Hollow Knight, the Knight is able to seal the Radiance within, taking the place of their sibling within the Black Egg.

If the Knight enters instead the mind of their sibling with the help of Hornet, they have the possibility to challenge the Radiance herself. However, with the Void unified under the Knight's will,[21] the battle takes a tragic turn for her. The Void itself slowly creeps in her dream, seeking to ensnare and consume the Radiance. At the end of the fight, it finally catches up with and immobilises her. The Shade of the Hollow Knight takes advantage to expose her core, to which the Knight's own Shade deals the last blows. The Radiance's Essence bursts out as the Void consumes her and vanishes from the Temple of the Black Egg, putting an end to the Infection.
