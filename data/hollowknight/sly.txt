Lore
Sly used to be the Great Nailsage.[3] During his previous occupation, he trained some disciples in the Nail Arts: Oro, Mato, and Sheo.[4]

Eventually, Sly abandoned his occupation as Nailsage. He became convinced of the strength of accumulating Geo over honing one's nail.[5] He thus turned to the simple life of a merchant, finding and selling wares from his shop in Dirtmouth.[6] He did not, however, forget his mastery and respect of the nail and those who practice its arts. [7] He keeps his greatnail in the basement of his shop and still remembers his pupils.[8]

At some point, a dream led him to wander off into the caverns below Dirtmouth.[9] He also lost his Shopkeeper's Key which ended up in a room in Crystal Peak.[10]
